<h3 id="searchresponse">2.2. Search Response</h3>

<p>If the search fails (cannot be executed), the return value is a status code 4xx or 5xx with an <a href="https://www.hl7.org/fhir/STU3/operationoutcome.html">OperationOutcome</a>.</p>
<p>If the search succeeds, the return content is a <a href="https://www.hl7.org/fhir/DSTU2/bundle.html">Bundle</a> with type = searchset containing the results of the search as an arbitrary list of resources. The search result list can be long, so servers MAY use paging. If they do, they MUST use this  <a href="https://www.hl7.org/fhir/STU3/http.html#paging">Paging</a> method for breaking the list into pages if appropriate. The server MAY also return an OperationOutcome resource with additional information about the search; if one is sent it MUST NOT include any errors, and it shall be marked with an entry mode of include.</p>

<p>A full set of response codes can be found here <a href="explore_api_codes.html">API Response Codes</a>. FHIR Servers MUST support the following response codes:</p>

<table>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>200</td>
      <td>successful operation</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>404</td>
      <td>resource not found</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>410</td>
      <td>resource deleted</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
