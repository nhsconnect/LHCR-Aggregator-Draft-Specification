<p>The 'update' interaction is performed by an HTTP PUT of the <code class="highlighter-rouge">{{include.resource}}</code> and creates a new current version of the resource to the NRL Registry endpoint.</p>

<!--<p>Return a single <code class="highlighter-rouge">{{include.resource}}</code> for the specified id{{include.content}}.</p>-->

<p>All requests MUST contain a valid <code class="highlighter-rouge">Authorization</code> header and MUST contain an <code class="highlighter-rouge">Accept</code> header and MUST contain an <code class="highlighter-rouge">If-Match</code> header. The <code class="highlighter-rouge">Accept</code> header indicates the format of the response the client is able to understand, this will be one of the following <code class="highlighter-rouge">application/fhir+json</code> or <code class="highlighter-rouge">application/fhir+xml</code>. The ‘If-Match’ header makes the request conditional. The server will process the requested DocumentReference only if its versionId property matches one of the listed ETags.</p>
